- Description: How does the brain weave information from the five senses
  into the rich tapestry of our experience? Lets find out! Illusions
  will reveal the brain can be a con artist. Experiments will reveal the
  physics that shapes human perception. By using the latest technology
  we will demonstrate how the senses are seamlessly integrated. Lets
  explore how the brain works with hands-on examples.

Students in this course will learn how humans use the sensory systems of
sight, taste, touch, smell, and hearing to perceive and interpret their
environment. We will draw upon information from a variety of fields,
including art, biology, physics, and psychology to address these issues.
In addition to covering the material in the text, we will discuss
current issues in perceptual research. The course is heavily weighted in
topics related to visual and auditory perception. This course may be
taken to fulfill a major requirement in Psychology, or a minor
requirement in Neuroscience. Students from all disciplines are welcome
in this course. Lectures are designed to provide an important foundation
of information and to improve your ability to process and synthesize
facts and concepts. Because exams will be primarily based on content
covered in lecture, lecture attendance is crucial to your success in
this course

## Demonstrations

- Chapter 1: Introduction  
  - Signal to Noise: Photography with long shutter has good SNR, rapid shutter freezes motion but has low SNR.
  - Thresholds: Detecting quiet sounds shows a ROC curve. We can change the volume to influence discriminability. We can use rewards or punishment to influence criterion.
  - Frequencies: We can take a sharp (focused) and blurry (unfocused) image of the same scene to show low frequencies. We can compute the difference between these two images to reveal the high frequencies (edges). Adding the high frequency to the original image emphasizes the edges, a method referred to as an [unsharp mask](https://github.com/rordenlab/spmScripts/blob/master/bmp_unsharpmask.m).
  - We can measure neural conduction time by using transcranial magnetic stimulation \[TMS\] to cause a finger movement. We can then measure the motor evoke potential to see the transmission delay time from the brain to the finger.

- Chapter 2: Light to neural signals  
  - Focal length and aperture: We can make pin hole cameras with different focal lengths (camera body caps with holes drilled in the center, lens adapters provide different focal length). We can adjust the aperture of a lens to reveal different depth of field and light transmission.
