- Description: How does the brain weave information from the five senses into the rich tapestry of our experience? Lets find out! Illusions will reveal the brain can be a con artist. Experiments will reveal the physics that shapes human perception. By using the latest technology we will demonstrate how the senses are seamlessly integrated. Lets explore how the brain works with hands-on examples.

Students in this course will learn how humans use the sensory systems of sight, taste, touch, smell, and hearing to perceive and interpret their environment. We will draw upon information from a variety of fields, including art, biology, physics, and psychology to address these issues. In addition to covering the material in the text, we will discuss current issues in perceptual research. The course is heavily weighted in topics related to visual and auditory perception. This course may be taken to fulfill a major requirement in Psychology, or a minor requirement in Neuroscience. Students from all disciplines are welcome in this course. Lectures are designed to provide an important foundation of information and to improve your ability to process and synthesize facts and concepts. Because exams will be primarily based on content covered in lecture, lecture attendance is crucial to your success in this course

Demonstrations
-------------------------------------------

- Chapter 1: Introduction 
	- Signal to Noise: Photography with long shutter has good SNR, rapid shutter freezes motion but has low SNR. 
	- Thresholds: Detecting quiet sounds shows a ROC curve. We can change the volume to influence discriminability. We can use rewards or punishment to influence criterion. (ROCui Matlab script) 
	- Frequencies: We can take a sharp (focused) and blurry (unfocused) image of the same scene to show low frequencies. We can compute the difference between these two images to reveal the high frequencies (edges). We can add the edges to the sharp image to enhance edges (sharpening). [bmp_unsharpmask Matlab script]. 
	- We can measure neural conduction time by using transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS] to cause a finger movement. We can then measure the motor evoke potential to see the transmission delay time from the brain to the finger.

	- Focal length and aperture: We can make pin hole cameras with different focal lengths (camera body caps with holes drilled in the center, lens adapters provide different focal length). We can adjust the aperture of a lens to reveal different depth of field and light transmission.

Assignments and Grade distribution
-------------------------------------------

The assignments during the term account for 75% of the grade, the final exam counts for 25%. 

- A = 90-100%
- B = 80-90%
- C = 70-80%
- D = 60-70%
- F = <60%

Goals
-------------------------------------------

- By the end of the term, successful students should be able to do the following
- Recognize the features and limitations of the five major sensory systems and the vestibular system.
- Explain the properties of the sensory receptors. 
- Describe how this often-ambiguous sensory information is integrated into a unified percept.
- Solve novel problems regarding perception using scientific experiments.
- Translate this knowledge to other domains. 
- Assess how politicians, advertisers, psychic and mentalists exploit our perceptual biases.
- Relate this knowledge to everyday human experience, and to the student’s own interests.

Expectations & Evaluation
-------------------------------------------

Sensation and Perception is designed to give insight into the basic processes of sensory and perceptual processes using novel, hands on activities. There were three approaches to this goal: (1) observation, (2) critical thinking (3) integration.

- There will be an emphasis on OBSERVATIONS, in which students reflect on what they sensed or perceived. 
- The class requires students to read Sensation and Perception by Wolfe et al. As in most other textbooks about sensation and perception, vision and audition will be covered most extensively compared to other sensory systems. Because the book is dense in material, all lectures are be posted online to guide students on the important concepts. The information from the text as well as the lecture is to help students CRITICALLY THINK about their observations.
- Formal evaluations will consist of quizzes and a Final Exam. There will also be a group project in which students are to present on a topic that INTEGRATES information from observations and formal neural/perceptual mechanisms.

Attendance
-------------------------------------------

Attendance throughout class is required. By registering for this class you are confirming your availability during class. If you must miss a class, you should talk to the instructor ahead of time. For emergencies (flu, car trouble) it is strongly preferred that you send a text message to the instructor at the time of the class. Failure to meet the 10% rule described in the academic regulations will have homework assignment scores diminished by the proportion of the absences across the term (e.g. missing 15% of classes will mean your final score reflects 85% of your homework score).



Plagiarism
-------------------------------------------

University policy regarding plagiarism, cheating and other forms of academic dishonesty is followed explicitly [See Carolina Community: Student Handbook and Policy Guide, Academic Responsibility]. Any case will be reported to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. A “0” score will be given on a plagiarized assignment, and may result in an “F” for the course in extreme cases.



Disabilities
-------------------------------------------

Students who have disabilities must have certification from the Office of Disability Services and must make clear during the first week of class what accommodations they expect. Students with disabilities must complete the same exams and assignments as other students in order to get course credit.
